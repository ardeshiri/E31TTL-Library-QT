# E31TTL-Library-QT
This project is mainly a C++ library to manage e31ttl Transceiver in order to use it as a radio controller but for now I'm using it 
to implement a chat infrastructure. The main windows class is very messy, I'm just using it to work on two trancseivers at the same 
time, testing and debugging the program and has no other use. the setting section is also incomplete.
